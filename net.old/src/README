tcpip_apimsg
 - I think its waiting for do_connected to call sem signal on op_completed,
   why and from where is do_connected called?
   Its on the call to tcp_connect from do_connect
   Its setup on tcp_connect in the tcp_pcb struct as a pointer to connect
   tcp_connect calls tcp_ouput with pcb structure
   We do get out of tcp_output, we get do_connect done and established message
   Go back to tcp_connect, what happens after tcp_output? 
   do_connect called tcp_connect, and returns to ?

We changed the field, connected to myconnected in
vi include/lwip/tcp.h to see if the compiler can warn us.

We are called from a macro, TCP_EVENT_CONNECTED in tcp_in.c
this seems to be that we wait on the event, then when it occurs,
we are released. The connect requires response from the network,
which we probably didn't get. Why? Either we can't really
talk to the device, or that we are not really running the tcp_input()
thread.

The order is :=
These functions are generally called in the order (ip_input() ->)
 * tcp_input() -> * tcp_process() -> tcp_receive() (-> application).


We are not getting any interrupt, try polling,
try setting up a simple perl http server on our local box,
and then try sending it a message using the ip addresses,
maybe the router isn't returning anything back and maybe
its not responding because we gave it a static address
which is not true.

We currently setup to all the irqs except pit.
We added the ne2k_isr call to the socket_timer,
we should then try to create an http server on think,
and try to connect to it. See if that works.

We need the following qemu:=

qemu-system-i386 -fda vmox.img -net nic,model=ne2k_isa -net user -net dump -redir tcp:7777::7777

Which creates a pass thru server on the local host at port 7777 to forward
to ox port 7777, if we then connect via httpclient.pl, we send
a message on the wire.

The qemu-vlan0.pcap file captures this data. But we do not
get any callback or interrupt to ox to read the data.

tcpdump -nnxr qemu-vlan0.pcap # To read messages on the wire.

There is a poll to call the isr, and it retrieves nothing.
