sys_i386.c is all the platform specific code needed
to run inside OX. He calls free() there, which may
not work for us, depending on where the memory came from.

Also, we do not need to write our own memory allocator,
we have one. And it is custom to OX.

Also, he calls schedule(), not sure how that's implemented,
but if there is a bug, it might be there.

We have our own schedule call, which we need to see if it
helps our not.

He tried to implement threads by selecting a different entry
point when the timer interrupt goes off. Not sure how he
is able to do that, and that code might be bad, not sure.

The code in question is here :=

net.old/src/sys_i386.c

See if we can salvage it and correct it.
It may have been the culprit in the old code all along.
